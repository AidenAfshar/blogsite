i am afraid of all. a pelican lies dead on the promonotory below. its neck twisted, feigning agony without a hint of an expression. a fragment of me wants to cry. every single bird passes on without a glance. the humans gawk about and don't gawk. grass grows along the edge of the rise. towering waves keep crashing into the mountain. pelicans keep their head down. i walk east. a piece of rumpled trash. a family in the lowrises of mud overlooking the waves under the bridge outside of the path. rememberances that don't exist. stillborn nostalgia. the idea of an adventure. throbbing calf. pinched neck. birdshit smeared on my hand. groans that don't come out. pale foam at the edge of the shore. my follies repeating ceaselessly.
